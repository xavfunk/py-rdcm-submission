## py-rDCM, a Python Implementation of Regression Dynamic Causal Modeling

This repository serves as the submission for my practical work in the context of the Vertiefungsmodul at the AE Theoretical Neurosciences.

It contains a python implementation of rDCM in the file py-rDCM-submission.py with auxiliary modules euler\_integration.so and wrap\_euler.py. 
Upon execution, py-rDCM-submission.py calculates synthetic and real testcases of the model.

Execution requires a linux-OS and python 3.8 environment with current versions of the packages numpy, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, tqdm and nilearn.

An accompanying report is provided in report.pdf explaining the project's background, rationale, testcases and differences to the original implementation.
